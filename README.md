Simple analysis and model checking tool for finite discrete time-homogeneous Markov chains (DTMC). 
Model checks PCTL properties and computes transient distribution.

In traditional model checking and automata theory, a lasso refers to the infinite part of a sequence accepted by an automaton (e.g. BÃ¼chi).

## Background
This tool is based on the material of the **Quantitative Verification** course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
