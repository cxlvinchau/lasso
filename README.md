# lasso
Simple analysis and model checking tool for finite discrete time-homogeneous Markov chains. 
Model checks PCTL properties and computes transient and steady state distribution.
In traditional model checking and automata theory, a lasso refers to the infinite part of a sequence accepted by an automaton (e.g. BÃ¼chi).

## Background
This tool is developed to practice contents from the **Quantitative Verification** course at TUM.
